Add this overlay to work with `crossdev` tool.
For now, I wiped it as most of changes that was made here are either already upstreamed, or not needed anymore.

But it is still possible that sometimes some packages would appear for some time (to monkeypatch things in non-gentoo-repo-acceptable way) before going to upstream or gentoo repo.
